========================================
Here is a tutorial on how to made and add app extensions.
========================================

Creating your own extension:

To create an extension, all you would have to do is have a Python 3.8.2 Script (To work with all versions of Sami
as of 4/20/2020.)

Name the file you want the OS to start reading first "index.py" (CaSe SeNsItIvE!)
You can have it redirect to other files, but make sure that there is one called index.py
to start off with. Then when you're done, place your scripts in the Cart1 folder.

Installing an extension:

All you have to do to install one is place the scripts from the .rar, .zip, etc. file, into the
Cart1 Folder in the main directory. Enjoy!
